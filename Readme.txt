#1. Makes a GET request to the provided IP geolocation API, which returns a JSON response containing the latitude and longitude for the IP address from which the request originated;
#2. Makes a subsequent request to the given weather API, which returns the current conditions for the latitude and longitude from the first step;
#3. Renders a User Interface that displays the temperature, a text description of the current weather conditions, an icon representing those conditions, and the city.
